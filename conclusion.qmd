# Conclusion
Taken together, the results show that global military spending is shaped far more by regional security pressures and geopolitical rivalries than by economic capacity. Wealth proves to be a poor predictor of defense burden, as seen in the consistent contrast between high-spending regions like the Middle East and low-spending wealthy democracies in Europe. Long-run trends highlight stable global power hierarchies dominated by the United States and China, while regional analyses reveal asymmetric arms dynamics driven by resource constraints, such as Azerbaijan’s oil-funded advantage over Armenia, Pakistan’s higher burden relative to India, and Iran’s sanctions-limited spending compared to Saudi Arabia. Finally, the Russia–Ukraine conflict illustrates how acute threats can rapidly reshape spending trajectories, triggering sharp increases across Europe and an extraordinary surge in Ukraine’s own military burden. Overall, the evidence demonstrates that insecurity—not income—is the central force structuring modern military expenditure.
