# Introduction
Military spending reveals how nations perceive threats and prioritize security. We chose this topic because defense expenditure provides a quantitative lens into shifting global power dynamics and geopolitical competition. Our analysis explores three questions: How does military spending relate to national wealth? What spending patterns emerge among regional rivals such as India–Pakistan and Saudi Arabia–Iran? And how do major conflicts influence defense budgets even in distant states? Using the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database (1949–2024) and Arms Transfers Database (1950–present), we examine the connections between spending, economic capacity, regional competition, and global  conflict. Understanding these patterns offers insight into how states allocate power, respond to perceived threats, and shape the broader architecture of international security.
